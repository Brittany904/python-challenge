# Project Overview

Using Python to analyze the financial data from two CSV files. Exporting the results of the analysis in text files.

# Process

First, importing the relevant CSV files using Python (Budget Data and Election Result Data). Then declaring necessary variables to the project, such as listing the first, second, and third candidate. 

Second, looping through each row in the file, calculating the number of votes per candidate. Then calculating the percentage of votes for the candidates and printing the election results. The results were then exported into a separate text file for clearer visualization.
